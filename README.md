## Setting Up

The following steps are necessary to set up the project in the development environment:

### Install

Install dependencies by running the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
# From root of the project.
yarn install or npm install
```
### Run

Run the following command to start the Websocket server and the front-end application.

```bash
# From root of the project.
npm start or ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Run the unit tests

To run the unit test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
# From root of the project.
ng test
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## The Application

The application consists of two flows: the admin user flow and the normal user flow.

### Design

The design process started with creating a wireframe for each page to have a better visual understanding of the application.


#### Auth

Login and Signup screeens.

#### Normal User

This todo list page displayed when the user logged as normal user.

#### Admin User

This user list page displayed when the user logged as admin user and can view the user translation history.

### Implementation

The low-fidelity design was used as a starting point for the implementation, skipping the high-fidelity design phase due to time constraints.

#### Auth

Implementation of the auth pages:

#### Normal User

Implementation of the normal user flow:

#### Admin User

## Important Decisions

The following implementation, and architectural decisions were taken throughout the development process:

### Architectural Decisions


  Following is the basic structure of the repo.

  - `apps`
    - `dashboard` (Front end built with React)
  - `packages`
    - `eslint-plugin`
  - `store`
    - `ngrx` (Used for translation button)

- Typescript was the primary language used for development.

### Implementation Decisions

- Angular was used for the implementation of the frontend with Angular Material.


## Checklist

This section provides a summary of my adherence to the requirements listed.

### ✅ Unit Tests

- Implemented with Jasmine.
- To run tests: `ng test` from project root
- Coverage:
